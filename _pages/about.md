About me
======
I am a first year PhD student in Electrical Engineering with broad interested in computer architecture, security, formal verification, and hardware design. I graduated from Duke University with a BSE in Electrical & Computer Engineering and a BA in Mathematics. Before beginning my PhD program, I worked for 3 years in ASIC physical design at NVIDIA doing RTL to gate level synthesis.
