I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, where I am working with Dr. Caroline Trippel and Dr. Kunle Olutokun. I am broadly interested in computer architecture, security, formal verification, and hardware design. In 2020, I graduated from Duke University with a BSE in Electrical & Computer Engineering and a BA in Mathematics, where I was lucky to be advised by Dr. Dan Sorin and Dr. Robert Calderbank.

Before beginning my PhD program, I worked at NVIDIA for 3 years in ASIC physical design doing RTL to gate level synthesis. Outside of research, I enjoy running, cooking, embroidering, and spending time outside!
