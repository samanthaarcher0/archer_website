I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, where I am advised by Dr. Caroline Trippel. I am broadly interested in computer architecture, security, formal verification, and hardware design. Currently, I am working on modeling hardware side channels that arise from data-dependent microarchitectural optimizations, in order to allow programmers to more precisely reason about the risk of their security-critical software leaking information via side channels.

Before beginning my PhD program, I worked at NVIDIA in ASIC physical design doing RTL to gate level synthesis. Before that, I graduated from Duke University in 2020, where I received a B.S.E. in Electrical & Computer Engineering and B.A. in Mathematics. During my undergrad, I was very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Dr. Dan Sorin and Dr. Robert Calderbank.
