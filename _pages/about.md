I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, where I work with Dr. Caroline Trippel and Dr. Kunle Olutokun. I am broadly interested in computer architecture, security, formal verification, and hardware design. Before beginning my PhD program, I worked at NVIDIA for 3 years in ASIC physical design doing RTL to gate level synthesis. In May 2020, I graduated from Duke University, where I majored in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Mathematics, and I was advised by Dr. Dan Sorin and Dr. Robert Calderbank. Outside of research, I enjoy running, cooking, embroidery, and spending time outside!
