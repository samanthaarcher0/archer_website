I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I am broadly interested in computer architecture, security, formal verification, and hardware design. In 2020, I graduated from Duke University with a BSE in Electrical & Computer Engineering and a BA in Mathematics. Before beginning my PhD program, I worked for 3 years in ASIC physical design at NVIDIA doing RTL to gate level synthesis.
